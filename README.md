RayTracer (school project)
=========

RayTracer UI project in C++/CLI - Runs on windows only :(

Different methods of rendering are implemented : 
    * RayCasting
    * RayTracing (with Bump Mapping)
    * Rasterizer (Orthographic Projection)

Scenes can be described and loaded dynamically from a json template, then object properties (such as position, color, texture, material indice...) can be modified manually.
The camera can also move you will have to wait for the scene to render again (don't expect more than 1 FPS).

So yes, this is a slow, over-engineered, piece of crappy code which probably has many bugs...
That being said, have fun with it !
